# Overview: Noise & VAD

Learn how Agent Voice Response intelligently handles **voice activity detection (VAD)** and **background noise** to create natural, responsive conversations.

---

## Smart Defaults

At its core, AVR manages the complexity of VAD for you.  
Our system uses multiple models working together to deliver a seamless experience out of the box.

We are intentionally **aggressive about triggering VAD**, because:

- **Latency Matters** → Users expect immediate responses in real-time voice conversations.  
- **Smart Models Compensate** → Neural VAD and noise cancellation reduce false positives and interruptions.  
- **Context is Key** → Conversation state helps determine when a user has truly finished speaking.  

> 💡 **Note:** AVR-CORE provides `VAD variables settings` that can be customized if necessary. However, adjusting VAD requires balancing trade-offs.

## Key Benefits

- ⚡ **Low Latency** → Aggressive VAD settings minimize response delays.  
- 🗣️ **Natural Conversations** → Context-aware models understand turn-taking and conversation flow.  
- 🎧 **Robust Audio Handling** → Built-in noise cancellation and background speaker management.  
- 🔧 **Minimal Configuration** → Works great with default settings for most scenarios.

## When to Customize

The default VAD settings are tuned for the vast majority of applications.  
Customization may be needed in cases such as:

- Extremely noisy environments  
- Accessibility requirements  
- Specialized conversational setups  

If you experience issues:

1. **Start with troubleshooting** → Verify audio setup and environment.  
2. **Test with default settings** → Ensure the problem is not environmental or hardware-related.  
3. **Make incremental changes** → Adjust one parameter at a time.  
4. **Monitor trade-offs** → Test thoroughly with real users and scenarios.

## Proceed with Caution

Changing VAD parameters involves trade-offs:  
- Lower latency may reduce accuracy.  
- Stricter detection may increase user frustration.  

We recommend trusting the intelligent defaults unless you have a **specific, validated need** to adjust them. Always test extensively before rolling out changes in production.
