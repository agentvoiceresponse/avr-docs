# Support the Project


## Why support AVR?

**Agent Voice Response (AVR)** is an open-source infrastructure designed to connect modern conversational AI systems (LLMs, ASR, TTS) with traditional telephony platforms such as **Asterisk** and **FreePBX**.  

The project makes it possible to:
- Integrate **cutting-edge AI models** (speech recognition, natural language, speech synthesis) into real-time phone calls.  
- Provide a **vendor-agnostic** framework: you can choose your preferred ASR, TTS, or LLM provider (e.g., Deepgram, Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs).  
- Simplify deployment through **Docker-based services**, making experimentation and production setups much faster.  
- Enable developers, researchers, and companies to **innovate in voice automation** without being locked to proprietary platforms.  

## Why your support matters

Maintaining AVR requires:
- Continuous updates to stay compatible with rapidly evolving AI providers.  
- Infrastructure for testing across different environments (Linux distros, cloud providers, PBX setups).  
- Documentation, tutorials, and community support.  

Your contribution helps ensure AVR remains **free, open-source, and actively developed**.

## How you can support
