# Contributing to AVR

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AVR! We welcome contributions that enhance the platform's capabilities through new provider integrations.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Integration Requirements

To contribute to AVR, you must implement an integration with one or more providers. Your integration should:

- Follow AVR's architecture and design patterns
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide clear configuration examples
- Include test cases
- Support the standard AVR interfaces

### 2. Provider Categories

You can contribute integrations in any of these categories:

#### ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)
- Implement speech-to-text conversion
- Support streaming audio processing
- Handle multiple languages
- Provide accurate transcription

#### LLM (Large Language Model)
- Implement natural language processing
- Support conversation management
- Handle context and memory
- Provide response generation

#### TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Implement text-to-speech conversion
- Support multiple voices
- Handle different languages
- Provide high-quality audio output

### 3. Integration Guidelines

Your integration should include:

1. **Docker Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Example docker-compose configuration
   services:
     avr-provider:
       image: your-provider-image
       environment:
         - PORT=6000
         - API_KEY=${PROVIDER_API_KEY}
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Required environment variables
   PROVIDER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   PROVIDER_CONFIG=config.json
   ```

3. **API Endpoints**
   ```typescript
   // Required endpoints
   POST /speech-to-text-stream  // For ASR
   POST /prompt-stream         // For LLM
   POST /text-to-speech-stream // For TTS
   ```

4. **Documentation**
   - Setup instructions
